slide 1
	remind what a group is
	remind what a ring is
	remind (via slide) what a field is
	remind how finite fields work
	make a note on dropping the "hat" for elements of a finite field

slide 2
	remind people of the euclidean algorithm 
	introduce modular exponentiation(?)

slide 3
	introduce elliptic curves and their properties
	introduce projective plane and points at infinity
	mention that we will be working with the "affine" part of curves, and so the point at infinity sort of vanishes

slide 4
	introduce elliptic curve addition law
	mention how it works if you reduce the curves mod p
	give explicit formulae for finite field addition

slide 5
	introduce lenstra's algorithm

slide 6
	do some examples with lenstra's algorithm
	discuss applications? like rsa?
