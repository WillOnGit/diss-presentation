slide 1
	remind what a group is
	remind what a ring is
	remind (via slide) what a field is
	remind how finite fields work
	make a note on dropping the "hat" for elements of a finite field

slide 2 & 3
	remind people of the euclidean algorithm 
	introduce modular exponentiation(?)

slide 4
	introduce projective plane and points at infinity
	introduce elliptic curves and their properties
	regular is well-defined tangents everywhere
	mention that we will be working with the "affine" part of curves, and so the point at infinity sort of vanishes

slide 5 & 6
	introduce elliptic curve addition law
	mention how it works if you reduce the curves mod p
	give explicit formulae for finite field addition

slide 7
	introduce lenstra's algorithm

slide 8+
	do some examples with lenstra's algorithm
	discuss applications? like rsa?
